# Getting Started 🚀

> 🚧 **Disclaimer: Project Status** 🚧
>
> The **thoth.id** project is currently under active development.
> * The nano contract has **not yet been launched** on any public Hathor network, but it will soon be deployed to the **testnet**.
> * The official API endpoint `domains.thoth.id` is **active**, but there are currently **no contract IDs** available. Once deployed to mainnet, there will be two endpoints:
>   * `mainnet.domains.thoth.id`
>   * `testnet.domains.thoth.id`
>   (with `mainnet` being the default).
>
> This SDK is provided for **testing and integration** purposes. You can use it with a **local development environment** or a **testnet contract**.
