# Welcome to the Thoth ID SDK

This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating the Thoth ID SDK into your applications. Whether you're building a new decentralized application (dApp) or integrating with an existing one, this SDK provides all the tools you need to interact with the Thoth ID naming system on the Hathor Network.

## What is the Hathor Network?

The Hathor Network is a scalable and easy-to-use blockchain platform designed for real-world use cases. It features a unique hybrid architecture that combines a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of transactions with a blockchain of blocks. This design allows Hathor to be highly scalable and to process a large number of transactions per second with no fees.

Key features of the Hathor Network include:

*   **Scalability:** A novel architecture that can handle a high volume of transactions.
*   **Ease of Use:** Simplified token creation and smart contract deployment.
*   **Security:** A secure and reliable network for decentralized applications.

## What is Thoth ID?

Thoth ID is a decentralized naming service built on the Hathor Network. It allows you to map human-readable names (e.g., `username.hathor`) to wallet addresses, effectively creating a digital identity on the blockchain. This simplifies the process of sending and receiving cryptocurrencies and interacting with dApps, as you no longer need to use long and complex wallet addresses.

With Thoth ID, you can:

*   **Create a unique digital identity:** Register a human-readable name that represents you on the Hathor Network.
*   **Simplify transactions:** Send and receive funds using your Thoth ID instead of a long wallet address.
*   **Build a reputation:** Your Thoth ID can be used across multiple dApps, allowing you to build a consistent reputation within the ecosystem.

## The Purpose of this SDK

The Thoth ID SDK is a TypeScript library that simplifies interaction with the Thoth ID nano contracts. It provides a set of easy-to-use methods that allow you to:

*   Resolve Thoth IDs to wallet addresses.
*   Check if a Thoth ID is available.
*   Register a new Thoth ID.
*   And much more!

By using this SDK, you can easily integrate Thoth ID functionalities into your applications without having to worry about the low-level details of interacting with the nano contracts.
